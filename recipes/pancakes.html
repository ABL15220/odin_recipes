    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy,
         and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen
          (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>


    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>180g of flour</li>
        <li>14g of baking powder</li>
        <li>12g of white sugar</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt (0.5g)</li>
        <li>30cl of milk</li>
        <li>42.5g of butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk,
             melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth</li>

        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle,
             using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry,
              about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
